        <p>This is the first book I remember in full. I was in second grade, 
            and the teacher red it alloud to the class. It was the first time 
            I was captivated by a book.</p>

        <p>This was the first 'classic' I read alone. There were points where 
            I kept a dictionary beside me, but this was my first taste of 
            bold sarcasm and mockery of society.</p>

        <p>Nibbles is a family favorite for bedtime in my home. I can almost 
            recite it from memory. It features a little monster who munches 
            into books and can then interact within them!</p>
