    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p class = "intro">My name is Jaci Brown. I am a 31 year old woman from Southern Mississippi. 
        I currently attend university at Bellvue University in persuit of a degree in Software Development.
        I also work full time as mortgage loan officer. I am married with one son and two dogs.
    </p>

    <p>In my free time, I enjoy crafting, cooking, and learning. My favorite drink is coffee. My favorite 
        food bite is the first tiny bite of a slice of pizza. My favorite craft is likely sewing, but it
        truly depends on my mood.
        </p>

    <p>Most of my hobbies involve creating something. I tend to feel that I've 
        wasted time when I just read for pleasure or play video games, though I do occasionaly 
        enjoy those activities too. I am hopeful that the persuit of software development 
        will allow me to create more things that can be more easily shared than a solitary physical object.
    </p>

    <p>Throughout my childhood, creating was an excellent means of emotional release. I am working dilligently 
        as a mother to share the love of creating with my child to promote creativity, resilience, and fine motor skills.
        <span class = "sentence">Creating things can also mask some of the formality of learning, as something you want to accomplish can 
        propel you forward with a zest for knowledge that eliminates most of the monotony. </span>
